# Automated-Traffic-Signal-Circuit-Using-555-Timer-IC
This project presents a low-cost, educational traffic signal simulation system based on the 555 timer IC in astable mode. Designed to model the standard red-yellow-green sequence found at road intersections, the circuit utilizes resistor-capacitor (RC) timing to generate continuous oscillations, driving LEDs in a fixed time loop. The goal is to provide a practical demonstration of basic electronics principles, including timing control, switching behavior, and sequential logic.

The system was first simulated using Proteus to validate time intervals and LED sequencing. Hardware implementation followed using a breadboard, LEDs, resistors, capacitors, and a 9V power supply. Testing confirmed that the timing cycle was stable, with each LED operating for a predictable duration. The project successfully achieved a functioning prototype suitable for educational and demonstration purposes.

Although simple, this system serves as a foundation for more complex traffic management models and highlights the relevance of analog timing circuits in real-world applications. Limitations include the lack of adaptive control or sensor feedback, making it ideal for small-scale or training setups but not for dynamic urban traffic. Future enhancements could include microcontroller integration or sensor-based automation for smarter traffic management.
